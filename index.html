                    This is code for a site generator that can create static pages, server-side dynamic pages,
                    and client-side dynamic pages. This specific code is in the form of an Instagram clone
                    with many of Instagram's features. It achieves this using JavaScript programming, asynchronous 
                    programming (AJAX), and REST APIs. This is both a webpage and the backend, although we were asked 
                    not to host the webpage publicly or store it in a public GitHub to comply with class guidelines.

                    This is the code for a scalable search engine that scours Wikipedia pages and returns
                    pages based on the input. This uses text analysis (tf-idf) and link analysis (PageRank),
                    and parallel data processing with MapReduce to return the best results.

                    This is a recreation of Metroid with a new mechanic. 
                    I was responsible for implementing all of the enemies, health, collectibles, doors, 
                    the custom mechanic, and the level. Additionally, I authored the research piece.

                    This is an improved version of the same game, polished after peer feedback. 
                    However, it was still implemented under a tight timeline.

                <p>
                    This is a rogue-like infinite runner-style game made by a group of three students over 
                    a little more than a month. I was responsible for implementing all non-boss enemies, collectibles, 
                    miscellaneous sprites, game balancing, and fine tuning. I also helped my partners with bug fixing in their sections.
                    Videos of the game can also be found at the link.

                    This was mostly made in Python
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a simple API project. I retrieved data from multiple APIs and stored it in an SQL database.
                    I then created a table joining information from the different
                    sources and added new values based on calculations derived from the original information.
                    Visuals were also created to further understand the information.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a simple Discord Bot I made for my little brother and his friends
                    with various commands. Many of the commands scrape information from a website 
                    to display video game stats, as there sadly is not any public API to use. There
                    are also some simpler commands added per their request.
